                                For many centuries, farmers, agricultural cooperatives,
                                associations, universities, and coconut sugar producers have
                                been struggling to find a healthy method for overcoming the
                                main problem of coconut sap fermentation during collection,
                                transportation and storage.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Most of the methods developed to inhibit sap fermentation
                                without the application of preservatives failed because they
                                were either labor-intensive, not practical, or too expensive
                                to implement on a continuous basis.

                            The present facilities can reach a production volume of 100
                            tons per month; expansions of 100 tons per year are in
                            planning.

                                Today, farmers are therefore still using preservatives in
                                the form of chemicals (alkalines), which are the simplest
                                and cheapest version of inhibiting the fermentation, which
                                however deteriorate the physical and chemical properties of
                                the sap, including its nutrients as well as its aroma and
                                taste, and therefore overall the quality of the end-product,
                                i.e. coconut sugar.

                                In the Phillippines, companies are using an expensive
                                resource-intensive method that requires workers to climb the
                                coconut trees every 4 hours on average to harvest the sap
                                before it ferments; such a method also limits the production
                                volume of coconut sugar to a certain extent.

                                        Things fortunately started to change in the year 2015,
                                        when the former national athlete and health-conscious
                                        engineer and businessman in the field of electrical,
                                        mechanical and chemical processes, Dieter Machate,
                                        together with his daughter, Natasha Machate, an expert
                                        in biological chemistry, commenced a project to study
                                        the behavior and activities of micro-organisms found in
                                        freshly collected phloem exudates (“sap”) of palm trees.

                                        The main objective of this project was to find and
                                        develop a method targeting the deactivation of
                                        microorganisms causing fermentation. The project was
                                        undertaken with phloem exudates originated from coconut
                                        and arenga trees naturally grown in the area of
                                        Pangandaran, a sub-province of West Java, Indonesia.

                                        After three years of research and trials, the Machate
                                        Family finally succeeded in inventing and developing a
                                        revolutionary, simple, but effective preservative-free
                                        method for delaying the natural process of sap
                                        fermentation caused by microorganisms. The patent
                                        application was filed in January 2018 with the patent
                                        offices in Indonesia and the Philippines.
